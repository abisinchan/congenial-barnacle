CSS Grid: Task Board

## Description

This project helped my understanding of Advance CSS Grid. This is a lesson in Codecademy in it's web development foundations. We created a board of to-do items organized into columns. All of the HTML and most of the CSS have been written by Codecademy , except the grid property declarations which I completed.
